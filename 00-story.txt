**Chapter 1: The Machines of Peace**
In the year 2147, the United Earth Council ended decades of war by creating the Antigravity Tank Program. Built by the world’s greatest engineers and commanded by elite crews, these tanks hovered above any terrain and fired shells in powerful arcs. They were deployed across ruined continents to enforce peace and ensure that no nation would ever dominate another again.

**Chapter 2: Ironfall**
Peace fractured during a joint military exercise in the shattered city of Ironfall. A test shot from the Eastern Fleet’s flagship tank was miscalculated, its shell soaring too far and crashing into a secured zone controlled by the Western Defense Corps. No one was hurt, but the message was clear—distance no longer meant safety.

**Chapter 3: Rising Tension**
Accusations spread across the world. Commanders blamed rivals, and nations questioned each other’s intentions. Tank cores were upgraded, launch systems reinforced, and targeting algorithms refined. What began as defense slowly transformed into preparation for war.

**Chapter 4: Lines Drawn**
Battle lines formed across deserts, frozen wastelands, and abandoned megacities. Antigravity tanks hovered above the ground, engines humming, cannons aimed skyward. Every nation believed it was acting to protect itself, yet each move pushed the world closer to conflict.

**Chapter 5: World War Tanks**
The first real shots were fired not out of hatred, but out of refusal to back down. Shells arced through the sky, crashing into steel and stone alike. In this new war, victory belonged not to numbers, but to those who mastered angle, power, and precision. And so began *World War Tanks*, a battle that would reshape the world until only one force remained.
