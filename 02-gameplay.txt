# 🎮 CORE GAME FUNCTIONALITY PROPOSAL

### *World War Tanks* — Playable Prototype (No UI)

## 🎯 Goal of This Phase

Create a **fully playable game loop** where:

* Two tanks can shoot each other
* Physics determines projectile paths
* Turns alternate correctly
* A winner can be determined

⚠️ **No menus, no buttons, no HUD, no intro UI**
Only gameplay systems.

---

## 1️⃣ Core Game Loop (MVP)

**Loop Definition:**

1. Player Tank A aims
2. Player Tank A shoots
3. Projectile resolves (hit or miss)
4. Damage applied
5. Turn switches to Tank B
6. Repeat until one tank is destroyed

This loop must work **100% reliably** before anything else is added.

---

## 2️⃣ Game Scene (Single Scene Only)

### Scene Name:

`GameScene`

### Responsibilities:

* Spawn tanks
* Handle input
* Handle physics
* Handle turns
* Detect win condition
* Restart game automatically

---

## 3️⃣ Tank Functionality

### Tank Properties:

* Position (x, y)
* Rotation (aim angle)
* Health (numeric)
* Active state (can act / locked)
* Sprite + physics body

### Tank Rules:

* Tanks do NOT move
* Tanks can only:

  * Aim
  * Shoot
* Only **one tank is active at a time**

---

## 4️⃣ Input & Aiming System (NO UI)

### Input Method:

**Mouse / Touch Drag**

### Functionality:

1. Click on active tank
2. Drag backwards from barrel
3. Calculate:

   * Angle
   * Power
4. Draw:

   * Temporary aiming line (debug line only)
5. Release to fire

⚠️ Aiming line is **debug-only**, not UI.

---

## 5️⃣ Shooting System (CRITICAL)

### Projectile Creation:

* Spawn at tank barrel
* Physics-enabled sprite
* Initial velocity based on drag distance

### Physics:

* Gravity enabled
* Air resistance optional (later)
* Collides with:

  * Ground
  * Tanks

### Rules:

* Only **one projectile at a time**
* Lock player input while projectile exists

---

## 6️⃣ Ground & Environment

### Ground:

* Static physics body
* Simple rectangle or terrain shape
* No destructible terrain (yet)

Purpose:

* Give projectiles something to hit
* Establish arc behavior

---

## 7️⃣ Collision & Damage System

### On Projectile Impact:

* Destroy projectile
* Trigger explosion logic
* Calculate damage

### Damage Rules:

* Direct hit → high damage
* Near hit → reduced damage
* Miss → no damage

Health reduces numerically (no UI display yet).

---

## 8️⃣ Explosion System (Visual Only)

### Explosion Behavior:

* Simple sprite animation
* Short duration
* Optional screen shake

Purpose:

* Visual feedback for hits
* Communicate power & impact

---

## 9️⃣ Turn Management System

### Rules:

* Game starts with Player A
* After projectile resolves:

  * Switch active tank
  * Enable input for next player

### Safety:

* Prevent double firing
* Prevent firing during projectile flight

---

## 🔁 10️⃣ Game Reset Logic

### Win Condition:

* Tank health ≤ 0

### On Win:

* Pause briefly (1–2 seconds)
* Reset:

  * Tank positions
  * Health
  * Turn order

⚠️ No victory UI — auto-reset only.

---

## 11️⃣ Debug Feedback (TEMPORARY)

Instead of UI, use:

* Console logs:

  * Current player
  * Damage dealt
* Debug lines:

  * Aim direction
* Tint active tank sprite

These will be removed later.

---

## 12️⃣ Technical Constraints

### Performance:

* Target 60 FPS
* Single scene
* Minimal assets

### Simplicity Rules:

* No sound required (optional)
* No menus
* No UI elements
* No asset polish

---

## 13️⃣ Success Criteria (VERY IMPORTANT)

The prototype is considered **SUCCESSFUL** when:

✅ Two players can take turns
✅ Shots follow realistic arcs
✅ Tanks can be destroyed
✅ Game loops endlessly
✅ No crashes or stuck turns

Only after ALL are true → UI phase begins.

---

## 14️⃣ What Comes AFTER This Phase (Not Now)

Later additions:

* Health bars
* Power meter
* Wind
* Terrain destruction
* Menu & intro
* Mobile controls

❌ **Do NOT add these now**

---

# 🏁 FINAL SUMMARY

This proposal ensures:

* Fast playable prototype
* Strong physics foundation
* Clean system separation
* Zero wasted effort on UI

> 🎯 **Make it playable first. Make it pretty later.**
