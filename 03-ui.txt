# 🧩 SIMPLE UI + START SCREEN FUNCTIONALITY PROPOSAL

### *World War Tanks* — Minimal & Functional

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Phase

* Add a **Start Screen** before gameplay
* Keep UI **minimal and fast**
* Avoid slowing down gameplay access
* Prepare structure for future expansion

---

## 1️⃣ Scene Flow Overview

```
StartScene  →  GameScene
                 ↑
              Restart
```

* No menus, no settings screens
* Only one transition before gameplay

---

## 2️⃣ Start Screen (StartScene)

### Purpose

* Give players a clear entry point
* Show game title
* Let players start immediately

---

### Start Screen Elements

#### 🪖 Game Title

* Text: **“World War Tanks”**
* Large, centered
* Simple font
* Optional subtle animation (slow fade-in)

---

#### ▶️ Start Button

* Text: **“Start Battle”**
* Centered under title
* Large clickable area

**Functionality:**

* On click:

  * Transition to `GameScene`
  * Initialize game state
  * Set Player 1 as starting player

---

#### 🧠 Controls Hint (Optional)

Small text at bottom:

> “Click and drag to aim. Release to fire.”

Purpose:

* Reduce confusion
* No tutorial screen needed

---

## 3️⃣ Start Screen Design Rules

* Static background (battlefield silhouette)
* No physics
* No sound required
* Screen is skippable (click anywhere = start)

---

## 4️⃣ Game Scene UI (Recap)

### Included UI Elements:

* Turn Indicator (top center)
* Health bars (near tanks)
* Restart button (top right)
* Optional power indicator (during aim)

All UI appears **only after game starts**.

---

## 5️⃣ Restart Behavior (Updated)

### Restart Button:

* Resets game
* Stays in `GameScene`

### Optional Restart-to-Start:

* Long press or double-click:

  * Return to `StartScene`

(Not required for MVP)

---

## 6️⃣ Win State UI (Minimal)

* Show text:

  * “Player X Wins!”
* Disable input
* Auto-reset after delay OR wait for restart click

No victory menu.

---

## 7️⃣ Technical Implementation Notes (Phaser)

### Scene Separation:

* `StartScene`

  * Title text
  * Start button
* `GameScene`

  * Gameplay
  * UI overlay

### Input Handling:

* StartScene captures all input
* GameScene input locked by turn manager

---

## 8️⃣ Success Criteria

This phase is successful when:

✅ Player sees a start screen
✅ Player can start game in one click
✅ Gameplay begins immediately
✅ UI is clear but minimal
✅ No UI blocks gameplay

---

## 🏁 FINAL SUMMARY

This structure gives you:

* A clean game entry point
* Minimal but useful UI
* A scalable scene flow
* No wasted development effort

> 🎯 **One button. One game. Zero friction.**
