# 🪖 TANK VISUAL DESIGN PROPOSAL

### *World War Tanks* — 2D Simple Style

---

## 🎯 Design Goals

* Instantly readable at a glance
* Clear aiming direction
* Works well with physics gameplay
* Easy to create and animate
* Low performance cost for web

---

## 1️⃣ Overall Tank Style

### Visual Style:

* **Flat 2D**
* **Low-detail**
* **Slightly cartoon-military**
* No realistic textures

### Perspective:

* **Side view (2D profile)**
* Barrel rotates in an arc
* Body remains static

---

## 2️⃣ Tank Size & Proportions

| Part   | Proportion |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Body   | 70% width  |
| Turret | 20% width  |
| Barrel | 10% width  |

### Suggested Sprite Size:

* **Tank body:** ~80×40 px
* **Barrel:** ~35×6 px

These sizes scale well across browsers.

---

## 3️⃣ Tank Components (Separated Sprites)

### 🧱 Tank Body

* Rectangular base
* Slight rounded corners
* Simple tread detail (just lines or circles)

**Color:**

* Player 1: Olive green
* Player 2: Desert brown / gray

---

### 🔄 Turret

* Circular or half-circle shape
* Centered on tank body
* Acts as rotation pivot

Purpose:

* Visually indicates aiming direction

---

### ➖ Barrel

* Thin rectangle
* Rotates independently
* Clear tip to show firing direction

Rules:

* Always visible
* Never blends into background

---

## 4️⃣ Color & Contrast Rules

* High contrast between tanks and background
* No camouflage patterns
* Avoid background colors close to tank colors

This ensures:

* Easy aiming
* Easy hit detection
* Better mobile visibility

---

## 5️⃣ Damage Visual Feedback

### On Hit:

* Tank briefly flashes white or red
* Small smoke puff near impact
* No complex damage decals

### On Low Health:

* Light smoke animation from body
* Barrel slightly shakes (optional)

---

## 6️⃣ Active Tank Indicator (Non-UI)

Instead of UI:

* Active tank has:

  * Slight glow outline
  * Brighter color tint
* Inactive tank slightly dimmed

Purpose:

* Communicates turn clearly
* No text needed

---

## 7️⃣ Destroyed Tank State

### Visuals:

* Body breaks into 2–3 pieces OR
* Body darkens and sinks slightly
* Larger explosion sprite

### Rules:

* Destroyed tank no longer responds
* Health bar hidden
* Collision disabled

---

## 8️⃣ Animation Requirements (Minimal)

| Animation       | Required    |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Barrel rotation | YES         |
| Firing recoil   | YES (small) |
| Explosion       | YES         |
| Idle movement   | NO          |

Keep animations short and subtle.

---

## 9️⃣ Asset Creation Guidelines

### Tools:

* Aseprite
* Piskel
* Photoshop / GIMP
* Or vector shapes drawn directly in Phaser

### File Format:

* PNG with transparency
* No sprite sheets needed for MVP

---

## 🔟 Variations (Future-Ready)

Without changing gameplay:

* Different barrel lengths
* Slight body shape changes
* Color swaps only

No size differences (for fairness).

---

## 11️⃣ Success Criteria

Tank design is successful when:

✅ Aiming direction is obvious
✅ Active tank is instantly clear
✅ Tanks are readable on small screens
✅ No visual clutter
✅ Easy to animate & code

---

## 🏁 FINAL SUMMARY

This tank design:

* Supports physics-based shooting
* Keeps visuals clean and readable
* Works perfectly for a 2D web game
* Scales well for future features

> 🎯 **Readable tanks = better gameplay.**
